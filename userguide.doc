Calculation for T1r or T2r maps.

	Single File :

		There are two methods for loading datas from
		your computer to software. 
		The first method is loading dicom's files, 
		you must to click on the button "LOAD DICOM 
		T*** Data" will appear a window to select the 
		folder where is your data, after a list of all 
		your datas, you must to choose whitch data will
		be processed. After loaded the file, you must 
		to click on the button "Go".

		The second method is loading nifti's files, you
		must to click on the button "Load Nifti" will
		appear a window to select your file. After loaded
		the file, you must to click on the button "Go" and
		put the time sequence.

		For both methods, after the calculation will 
		apper a window to select where user want to 
		save the maps (results).
 
	Multiples Files:

		To load multiples files, all of them must to be
		nifti files. You must to click on the button 
		"Load Multiples Niftis", will appear a window
		to select the files. The software will only 
		calculate the files with T1r and T2r in the name,
		the rest it will be skip. User must to click on 
		the button "Go", and after put the time sequence.
		The maps (results) will be save automatically by 
		the software with '_map'in the end of the name.

Calculation for MT or RAFF maps.

	Single File :

		There are two methods for loading datas from
		your computer to software. 
		The first method is loading dicom's files, 
		you must to click on the button "LOAD DICOM 
		T*** Data" will appear a window to select the 
		folder where is your data, after a list of all 
		your datas, you must to choose the +Z and -Z RAFFs
		dataset to be processed. After loaded the files, 
		you must to click on the button "Go".

		The second method is loading nifti's files, you
		must to click on the button "Load Nifti" will
		appear a window to select your RAFF (+Z) dataset,
		after the RAFF(-Z). 
		After loaded the file, you must to click on the 
		button "Go" and put the time sequence.

		For both methods, after the calculation will 
		apper a window to select where user want to 
		save the maps (results).

	Multiples Files :

		To load multiples files there are 2 options
		load files concatenated (+Z + -Z) and 2 files (+Z and -Z)
		all of them must to be nifti files. 
		You must to click on the button "Load Multiples Niftis", will appear a window
		to select the files. For 1 input files concatenated must to have 'raff' or 
		'RAFF' in the name. For 2 input files the software will separate inversion
 		files and non-inversion files from inputs, to join the files in 1. 
		After it the software need to make the pairs to process them.
		Example of identification:

		2217A_14s_gre_prep_raff3_inv_tr10_cor.nii
		2217A_15s_gre_prep_raff3_plu_tr10_cor.nii 

		The software is deleting the identificator of minus and
		plus and comparing the names, it must be the same. 
		For plus files, the software will identify this types of string:
		'plus','plusZ','1plu'.
		And for minus files this:
		'minus', 'minuZ', 'minusZ', 'inv','2inv'.

		User must to click on the button "Go", and after put
		the time sequence.
		The maps (results) will be save automatically by 
		the software with '_map'in the end of the name.

Concatenation for RAFF's

	Concatenate 2 files (+Z,-Z) in 1 files (+Z + -Z):
		The junction is made by the order of input files,
		to load files they must to be in the same order.
		First load all the plus files. Second load all the 
		minus files. It will be join considering the order of input. 
        	After the calculation output is saving automatically
 		in the folder of input, using the same name of the
		plus files, but with '_conc' in the end of the name.
		
	Concatenate Multiples files (2 in 1)
		Works the same way of multiples files from raff, when
		you are loading 2 input files.
